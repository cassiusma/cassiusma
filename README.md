- 👋 Hi, I’m @cassiusma or Cassius Manuel. I'm working at CIBIV, in the Max Perutz Labs.
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms that combine discrete mathematics and analysis. In particular, I've been focused on Markov models of evolution and Maximum Likelihood Estimates.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Mathematica competitively. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing algorithms based on nice mathematical objects.
- 📫 You can reach me by E-mail: cassiusmanuelperez@gmail.com
